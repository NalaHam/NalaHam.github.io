There are observed sex disparities in both incidence and mortality for many non-reproductive related diseases that have yet to be explained by environmental or gender differences. Research into the genomic mechanisms of sex bias in disease is a relatively new and on going field of study. My work investigates the role of sex chromosomes on differing disease response through large scale genomic comparative analyses using repositories like the Cancer Genome Atlas program (TCGA) and Genotype-tissue Expression project (GTEx).
