It is well known that males have a higher incidence and mortality for the majority of non-reproductive cancers, and many other diseases, but the genomic mechanisms behind this sex disapity are largely unknown. My work investigates the role of escape genes on the inactive X chromosome in females in disease response and how they might contribute to the sex disparities seen in diseases. This is done using comparision analyses on large genomic databases like the Cancer Genome Atlas program (TCGA) and Genotype-tissue Expression project (GTEx).
