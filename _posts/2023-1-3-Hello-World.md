For many non-reproductive related diseases there are observed sex disparities in both incidence and mortality that have yet to be explained by environmental or gender differences. Research into the genomic mechanisms of sex bias in disease is a relatively new and ongoing field of study. My work investigates the role of sex chromosomes on differential disease response between the sexes through large-scale genomic comparative analyses using repositories like the Cancer Genome Atlas program (TCGA) and Genotype-tissue Expression project (GTEx). Recently, my research has been focused on how "escape genes", on the female X-chromosome, can influence disease response in cancer. With the intention of expanding my work into other diseases like HIV, COVID-19, and autoimmune disease.
