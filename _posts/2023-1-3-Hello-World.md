For many non-reproductive related diseases there are observed sex disparities in both incidence and mortality that have yet to be explained by environmental or gender differences. Research into the genomic mechanisms of sex bias in disease is a relatively new and on going field of study. My work investigates the role of sex chromosomes on differing disease response between the sexs through large scale genomic comparative analyses using repositories like the Cancer Genome Atlas program (TCGA) and Genotype-tissue Expression project (GTEx). Recently I have been studying how escape genes on the female X-chromosome can influence disease response in cancer and I hope to expand this study into other dise HIV, COVID-19, and autoimmune disease.
